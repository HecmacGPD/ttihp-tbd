## How it works

Project to implement a Hall Effect Sensor on the IHP26a shuttle. Makes use of a simple n-doped plate type hall sensor, 2 stage amplifier, Internal ADC, with digital readout. Ambitious, so unsure if success is possible yet. 

## How to test

Present a strong magnet to the TT chip, 7 segment display will respond by increasing digit displayed.
Connect VGA PMOD, Graphic corresponds to field strength.

## External hardware

Magnet, 7 segment display, VGA PMOD.
